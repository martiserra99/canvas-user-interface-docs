You can also define what we call layout parameters. These are parameters that its children can use to define how they have to be placed (ex: in a specific row and column). To define these layout parameters, you have to use the method `.layoutParams.set(param, value)`, like so:

```javascript
rowsType.layoutParams.set("row", 0)
```
