Every element can respond to some events and execute what we call event listeners. Event listeners are functions that are called when a specific event happens (ex: click).

There are some common events that every element can respond to (click, mousedown, keydown...) and there are other events that are specific to the type of view, layout and composite (ex: a specific key is pressed). When creating a type you can define what are these other events that the type will be able to respond.
