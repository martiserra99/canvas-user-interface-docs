# Installation

To start using this library you have to download it from the home page. You have to include the downloaded file in your project and you have to import the `canvasUI` object, like so:

```javascript
import canvasUI from "./canvasui-js.js";
```

This is the main object and it is the one you will use to build the user interface with its graphical elements.

Now you are ready to start using the library. Keep in mind that you need to start a local server to be able to use it and one way to achieve it is by using the Live Server plugin of Visual Studio Code.
