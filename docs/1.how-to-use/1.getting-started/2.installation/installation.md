This library is available in npm. You can download it doing the following:

```bash
npm install canvas-user-interface
```

Then, to use the library you have to import the `canvasUI` object:

```javascript
import canvasUI from "canvas-user-interface"
```

This is the main object, and it is the one you will use to build the user interface with its elements.
