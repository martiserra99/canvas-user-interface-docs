To start using this library you can download it from the home page, include the downloaded file in your project and import the `canvasUI` object, like so:

```javascript
import canvasUI from "./canvas-user-interface.js"
```

This is the main object, and it is the one you will use to build the user interface with its elements.

You can also download the library from npm:

```bash
npm install canvas-user-interface
```
