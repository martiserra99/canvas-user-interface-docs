### corner

It defines how the corners are drawn. It is an object with the properties `type` and `size`.

The `type` property can be `"cut"` to define that the corners have to be cutted and it can also be `"round"` to define that the corners have to be rounded.

The `size` property is a number that defines how much the corners will be cutted or rounded.

Its default value is:

`{ type: "cut", size: 0 }`
