nav: alignContent
title: alignContent

In case that the size of the content (the rows and columns) is less than the size of the layout you can use this property to define how the content is aligned in the layout. It is an object with these properties:

- **horizontal**: It is the horizontal alignment and it can be `"left"`, `"middle"` and `"right"`.
- **vertical**: It is the vertical alignment and it can be `"top"`, `"middle"` and `"bottom"`.

Its default value is:

```javascript
{
  horizontal: "middle",
  vertical: "middle"
}
```
