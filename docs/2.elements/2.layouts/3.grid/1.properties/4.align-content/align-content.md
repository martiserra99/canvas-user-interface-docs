It is an object that has the properties`horizontal` and `vertical`.

The `horizontal` property is the horizontal alignment and it can be `"left"`, `"middle"` and `"right"`.

The `vertical` property is the vertical alignment and it can be `"top"`, `"middle"` and `"bottom"`.

Its default value is:

`{ horizontal: "middle", vertical: "middle" }`
