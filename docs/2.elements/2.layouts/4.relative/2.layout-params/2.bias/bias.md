It is only used when the child is attached to both sides of the same direction. When that happens you can use this property to define a percentage that specify how near is the child to what side.

It is an object that has these properties:

- **horizontal**: It is a percentage that represents how near is to the left and to the right.
- **vertical**: It is a percentage that represents how near is to the top and to the bottom.

Its default value is:

```javascript
{
  horizontal: 50,
  vertical: 50
}
```
