### bias

It is only used when the child is attached to both sides of the same direction. When that happens you can use this property to define a percentage that specify how near is the child to what side.

It is an object that has the properties `horizontal` and `vertical` and each one of them has to contain a number that represents a percentage.

Its default bias is:

`{ horizontal: 50, vertical: 50 }`
